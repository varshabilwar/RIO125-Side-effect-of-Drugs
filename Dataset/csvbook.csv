The only other major side effect has been frequent bleeding and much heavier periods than usual.  I normally have a fairly light, short period (2 days normal bleeding, 1-2 of spotting). But there have been two occasions since starting Lyza in which I have woken up in a pool of blood on the bed because the bleeding is so heavy and unexpected. There has been some bloating as well, but I'm not sure if that is due to the pill because I had the same issue with Mirena. I have my suspicions about ovarian cysts, so that could be causing the bloating, breast tenderness, and abnormal bleeding. I rated ease of use as one star because it has been very difficult for me to remember to take the pill on time even though I set an alarm on my phone. However, it is still effective because I haven't gotten pregnant yet. I just make sure to use back up protection, or abstain for 3 days after taking a pill late.

I'm not on birth control (but i should be) because i dont want my mother to think that im having sex etc. So i went to las vegas and for the first four days i was there i didnt get my period (thank god) and the fifth day i got it and took the pills that morning afternoon and night for the first few days of my period hoping that it would have some effect. Well, it didn't. I was so pissed off because i get terrible periods where i can't get out of bed and i'm really not a nice person and highly emotional and it's just not a good time for me.

We are talking the first 3 days so heavy that leaving the house was a challenge. I would go through 2 packages of overnight pads plus superplus tampons every period. Ruining clothing, sleeping with a towel in the bed, cramping severly with large blood clots. Birthcontrol pills had the reverse effect on me causing me to bleed 3 weeks on and 1 week off. So no good. Finally, years later a doctor finally recognized the help I needed and suggested Lysteda and I love it. Now I only use 1 package of pads with some left over. My life is on again. I can enjoy outings with my husband and children without panic of changing a pad and tampon within 30 minutes. The only side effects I have using the pills are: dry mouth and headaches with a hot feeling in my stomach at times. So I have to increase my water intake, drink gatorade and keep the ceiling fan going at night so I don't sweat while taking it. Overall, Lysteda works for me.

35-44,Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods,1/11/2012,lysteda,154120,5,5,"I took Lysteda for the first time this month. So far I'm extremely happy with it. Had cramping but no more than usual. What was unusual was I felt a contraction type feeling the 3rd morning after I took the Lysteda that lasted about a 1/2 hour. The contraction feeling was not painful, just freaky. No other unusual side effects noted at this time. The number of days on cycle were as usual. My flow was reduced by 50% or more. I was not tied to a bathroom like I usually am on days 2-5! I messed up on the dosage the first day and only took one 650mg tablet in the morning and afternoon. Taking only one had reduced it some (like 20%) but not as much as it did once I got my actual prescription and noticed I needed to take two 650mg tablets, three times a day. My doctor prescribed it correctly, I had forgotten how many she said. It seemed like it would be a lot to remember taking the meds at first, but if someone has a vested interest such as I, you don't forget...believe me! I did start the meds on day 2 and stopped at bedtime on day 5, my doctor says however I should start taking them on day 1. I am not a big fan of taking medication for anything, but I recommend Lysteda because it was very freeing. I will try to remember to post updates after continued usage, especially if I develop side-effects. I've found the reviews of others very helpful to me.  

Note for medical professionals: A strange occurance that may be linked to the contraction type feeling on morning 3. I had two ultra sounds. One about a week after my last period ended and one two days after this past period ended (lysteda usage) and the technician told me my uterus was significantly smaller in size. Not sure if that has anything to do with the Lysteda, but it may be noteworthy. If not disregard.",5,Female,"Nausea ,  vomiting ,  diarrhea , and  muscle pain  may occur.",13

I took Lysteda as prescribed when I first noticed bleeding and it did decrease the amount of blood but I am now going on almost two weeks of medium light bleeding. Has this happened to others?
